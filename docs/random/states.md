### Pre Completion OPT
- Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a temporary employment authorization issued by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
- This type of work authorization occurs prior to students' degree completion and before the program end date stated on the I-20.
- Students must have already completed at least `one academic year (fall and spring semester)` as a full-time student to be eligible for Pre-Completion OPT. 
    - `That is 9 months`.
- Pre-Completion OPT can be full-time (more than 20 hours per week) or part-time (20 hours or less per week). 
- Full-time Pre-Completion OPT is only available to students: 
    a. During summer _OR_
    b. Graduate students who have completed all course requirements and are only left with a project/thesis/comprehensive exam in their final semester.
- We recommend you schedule an [appointment](https://www.sjsu.edu/isss/about/contact.php) with an International Student Advisor to discuss pre-completion OPT.
- What if I have Pre-Completion authorization, but donâ€™t ever find a job?
    - >>> The time you utilize, regardless of whether you find a job or not, will be `deducted from the 12 months of OPT` you are granted, but your F-1 status will still remain valid.

#### First Plan
Three semesters each: 
- Fall:           4 courses = 12 units
- Spring:         4 courses = 12 units
- Fall: 3 courses =  9 units `?? NOT FULL TIME STUDENT`
    - Take extra three units
    - Move a course to another semester, left with GP only and Pre-OPT

- Fall (August-December): 5 courses = 15 units
- Spring (Jan    - June    ): 4 courses = 12 units
- Summer (June   - August  ): `Pre-Completion OPT`
- Fall   (August - December): `Pre-Completion OPT` + GP 6 units

>>> Start OPT in December

- Fall (August-December): 5 courses = 15 units
    - Total Cost:
        - 4,967 + 15 * 420 = 11,267 USD
        - 5 * 800 = 4,000 USD
        - >>> `Total`: 11,267 >>> 11,267 + 4000 = 15,267 USD 
- Spring (Jan - June): 4 courses = 12 units
    - Total Cost:
        - 4,967 + 12 * 420 = 10,007 USD
        - 5 * 800 = 4000 USD
        - `Total`: 10,007 >>> 10,007 + 4000 = 14,007 USD
- Summer (June-August): `Pre-Completion OPT`
    - Total Earning: 
        - 35 (`avg`) * 4 (part-time) * (69+7+12-25) days = 35 * 4 * (69+7+12-25) =  `8,820` USD
        - 35 (`avg`) * 8 (full-time) * (69+7+12-25) days = 35 * 8 * (69+7+12-25) = `17,640` USD
        - NOTE:
            - Will be working Full Time.
            - No idea: 
                - How many week ends but I estimated them to be `25 days` from May 22 till Aug 17
                - When exactly I will find a job.
    - Total Cost:
        - 100 * (69+7+12) days = 8800 USD

    - Final Total: 12,460 - 7,487 = `+4,973` USD

Third Plan total cost is:
BEST  CASE Scenario: -15,267 -14,007 +4430 +4,973  = 10,663 USD
